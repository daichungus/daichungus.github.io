<h2>Choosing a distro</h2>
<p>For this guide, I am using Fedora 42 with KDE, and have tested this process on Ubuntu with GNOME, 
    but most major distros should work with this guide as well.</p>
<h2>Installing required software</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Update your repository using your distro's included package manager.</li>
        <li>If not already included, install flatpak and add the flathub repo.</li>
        <li>Install Wine and Lutris.</li>
        <li>Using flatpak, install ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
        <li>Open ProtonUp-Qt to install ProtonGE to the Lutris.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Adding and running the Touhou games</h2>
    <h3>Running vanilla Touhou</h3>
    <p>This is if you want to play without THCRAP patches.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Lutris, then add "locally installed game".</li>
        <li>Enter the game name. Choose Wine as the Runner.</li>
        <li>Locate your game's exe (usually thXX.exe except for EoSD) for the executable path. This will also work for vpatch executables.</li>
        <li>Set the working directory path to be the same window the game is located in.</li>
        <li>Locate your Wine prefix. Usually this is located as <code>~/.wine</code></li>
        <li>For Runner options, I usually use the System wine.</li>
        <li>Press the save button and ensure your game is running.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Running with THCRAP patches</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat the same steps above, but for the executable path in Game options, locate <code>thcrap_loader.exe</code></li>
        <li>
            <p>In the Arguments box, enter the <code>.js</code> file of your patch and the game you want to run it with.</p>
            <p>Example: <code>en.js th06</code> for running the English patch of EoSD.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure the working directory is the folder that contains <code>thcrap_loader.exe</code> (it should usually be named <code>thcrap/</code></li>
        <li>Press the save button and ensure your game is running. There should be a small window that has the name "Touhou Community Reliant Automatic Patcher</li>
    </ol>
<hr class="light">
<p>NOTE: While vpatch is not required for reducing input lag, it's useful for resizing the window.</p>
